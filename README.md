## 🧠 SQL Analytics

Practical SQL case studies from the [8-Week SQL Challenge](https://8weeksqlchallenge.com/), covering complex joins, window functions, CTEs, and business analysis queries.

| Challenge | Description | Tools |
|------------|--------------|-------|
| 🍜 **Danny’s Diner** | Analyse customer visit patterns, spend and favourite menu items to inform a loyalty program and generate easy-to-inspect summary tables. | MySQL |
| 🍕 **Pizza Runner** | Clean and transform order & runner data to measure pizza/runner metrics (volumes, delivery performance, ingredient usage, pricing & profitability). | MySQL |
| 🥪 **Foodie-Fi** | Analyse subscription & churn behaviour, customer onboarding journeys, and build a payments table to model monthly/annual billing. | MySQL |
| 🏦 **Data Bank** | Calculate customer balances, node allocations and data-provisioning requirements (including monthly forecasts and an interest-based growth option). | MySQL |
| 🧺 **Data Mart** | Clean weekly sales data and perform before-and-after analysis to quantify the sales impact of a June 2020 sustainability change across regions/platforms/segments. | MySQL |
| 🦞 **Clique Bait** | Join user/events/campaign data to compute funnel fall-out, campaign performance, page event flows and conversion metrics. | MySQL |
| 🥾 **Balanced Tree Clothing Co.** | Analyse product-level sales and merchandising metrics to produce basic financial and sales performance reports for the merchandising team. | MySQL |
| 🍊 **Fresh Segments** | Analyse aggregated interest metrics and rankings to profile client customers’ interests and provide high-level marketing insights. | MySQL |

## 🐍 Python Projects

End-to-end data projects covering analytics, data pipeline, and machine learning including MLOps workflows.  
Each project folder includes code, notebooks, and documentation.

### 📈 Analytics
- 🛒 **Online Retail RFM Analysis**
  
  Analyzes customer purchasing behavior using RFM (Recency, Frequency, Monetary) scoring to identify high-value and at-risk customers and optimize marketing strategies. The dashboard highlights revenue distribution across segments, customer mix, and behavioral patterns through bar charts, pie charts, scatterplots, and a heatmap. Python code can be found [here](https://github.com/deedeepratiwi/retail-rfm-analysis/blob/main/rfm_analysis.ipynb).

- 📚 **Seattle Public Library Cohort Analysis**
  
  Analyzes library title retention and longevity through cohort analysis. Instead of focusing on user churn, it tracks how new titles released each month perform over time — identifying when they drop off, which cohorts retain engagement the longest, and how total collection size evolves. Python code can be found [here](https://github.com/deedeepratiwi/seattle-public-library-cohort-analysis/blob/main/seattle_public_library_cohort_analysis.ipynb).

### 🔩 Data Pipeline
- 🚧 on progress
  
### 🤖 Machine Learning
- 🏨 **Hotel Booking Cancellation**
  
  An end-to-end MLOps pipeline that predicts hotel booking cancellations using the Hotel Booking Demand dataset. The project demonstrates the full machine learning lifecycle — from data preprocessing and model training with MLflow tracking, to serving the model via FastAPI, containerizing with Docker, and monitoring performance through Prometheus + Grafana.
  Python code can be found [here](https://github.com/deedeepratiwi/mlops-hotel-cancellation).

## 📈 Dashboards

Interactive data visualizations and dashboards published on Tableau Public.

- 🌋 **Indonesia Ring of Fire**
  
  Visualizes the distribution and characteristics of Indonesia’s volcanoes — part of the Pacific “Ring of Fire.” Data was collected through a custom Python web scraper from Wikipedia, then cleaned in Microsoft Excel. Python code for web scraping can be found [here](https://github.com/deedeepratiwi/web-scraping-indonesia-volcano/blob/main/Web_Scraping_Indonesia_Volcano.ipynb).
  
  ![Indonesia Ring of Fire](images/ring_of_fire.png)
  
- 🛰️ **Maven Telecom Customer Churn Analysis**
  
  Examined telecom customer churn drivers by contract type, tenure, and service features to identify key retention opportunities and improve subscription longevity.

- 🦠 **Covid-19**
  
  Visualized Indonesian COVID-19 active, recovered, and deaths cases based on [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/hendratno/covid19-indonesia) dataset to see the spread of the disease overtime on every provinces.

- 🎥 **Neflix**
  
  Analyzed the Netflix catalog by genre, release year, and country distribution to uncover trends in content diversity, regional focus, and production evolution over time.
